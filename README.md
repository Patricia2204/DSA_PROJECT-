Project Overview
This Data Analysis project aim is to support the Abuja division of Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) which specializes in office supply and furniture on the appropriate shipping cost based on order of priority

Based on the query it shows that the order priority impact the shipping cost, i.e delivery truck which is more economical is used to deliver higher number of products and critical product which is at risk for late delivery and product might be damaged which could cause customer a dissatisfaction.

Based on the query, the highest shipping cost does not match the highest order priority because the shipping cost are not based on emergency but it is based on maximization

My advice for the company is that the express air should be used for product of high demand, urgent and critical order priority.
The regular air should be used for the medium and not specified order priority while the delivery truck should be used for low order priority.

With this method or approach, the company will be able to give maximum satisfaction to their customers.
